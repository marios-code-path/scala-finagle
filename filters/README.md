# What is Finagle

In this example, we will go through the steps to deploy a Filtered HTTP Service with [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).

[Finagle](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/) is an extensible [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) system for the JVM, that lets developers write non-blocking, high-concurrency services with ease. Much of what Finagle will let us do is summarized in the [doc](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/).

> Finagle implements uniform client and server APIs for several protocols, and is designed for high performance and concurrency. Most of Finagleâ€™s code is protocol agnostic, simplifying the implementation of new protocols.

# Build with SBT

This example, and others like it will rely on a quick and simple build tool. Lets examine this [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) build for the dependencies used in this example. We only need to include "finagle-http" dependency at version 18. This is using [Finagle 6](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/changelog.html).

```c
name := "sample-filters"
version := "1.0"
libraryDependencies += "com.twitter" %% "finagle-http" % "18.8.0"
libraryDependencies += "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.1.3"
```

# Services

We will define an HTTP service that returns the minimum value of a sequence of integers. The user inputs a 'next' integer, then the service emits the smallest of all values.  

```scala
package example

import com.twitter.finagle.http.{Response, Status}
import com.twitter.finagle.{Service, http}
import com.twitter.util.Future

object SampleService extends SampleService

class SampleService extends Service[http.Request, http.Response] {

  val seed = Seq(76, 69, 71, 48, 83, 42)

  def apply(req: http.Request): Future[http.Response] = {
    val response = Response(req.version, Status.Ok)
    val sample: Seq[Int] = seed ++ Seq(req.getIntParam("next",100))

    response.setContentString(s"Minimum target sample is: ${sample.min}")

    Future.value(
      response
    )
  }

}
```

# Filters

 Filters lets us change the input and output types for a given service, wrap service logic (eg with logging) and even simplify the relationship between a services configured states through composition. Lets see what Twitter docs say about Filters:

```java
 * A [[Filter]] acts as a decorator/transformer of a [[Service service]].
 * It may apply transformations to the input and output of that service:
 * {{{
 *           (*  MyService  *)
 * [ReqIn -> (ReqOut -> RepIn) -> RepOut]
 * }}}
```

Given a `Service` provides the translation between two types `ReqOut` and `ReqIn`, a `Filter` allows turn those types into new types, thus `ReqIn` and `RepOut`. Filters maintain API consistency with ordinary `Service`s through [Service](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/com/twitter/finagle/Service.html) trait, with that we also get an overloaded compositional method [andThen()](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/com/twitter/finagle/Service.html#close():com.twitter.util.Future[Unit]) that allows us to glue together filters and services.

To visualize what this means, lets take a look at the good docs: ![Filter Viualization](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/_images/filter2.png)

# Filter Example

As a practial example, I have defined an example filter to log HTTP requests.  This is a simple re-use of the existing [LoggingFilter](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/com/twitter/finagle/http/filter/LoggingFilter.html) which takes a [CommonLogFormatter](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/com/twitter/finagle/http/filter/CommonLogFormatter.html) for configured log formatting.

```scala
package example

import com.twitter.finagle.http.filter.{CommonLogFormatter, LoggingFilter}
import com.twitter.finagle.http.{Request, Response}
import com.twitter.finagle.{Http, Service}
import com.twitter.logging.Logger
import com.twitter.util.{Await, Duration}

object MyLoggingFilter
  extends LoggingFilter[Request]({
    val log = Logger("access")
    log.setUseParentHandlers(true)
    log
  }, new CommonLogFormatter)

object SampleApp extends App {
  val service: Service[Request, Response] = MyLoggingFilter.andThen(SampleService)

  val server = Http.server
    .serve(addr = ":8080", service)

  Await.ready(server)
}

```

In order to take advantage of the behaviour modificaion that this filter allows, we'll need to compose our final exposed service. We can do this with the `andThen` method used to glue `Service`s together.  The returened composition will have the same input and outputs as our original service, with the added bonus of HTTP logging.

This example uses the Http singleton object to instantiate a listening HTTP 1.1 server.
Finally, because we are running on our own synchronous main method, make sure we need to block on something for the HTTP server to have a chance to respond to requests. We can block on the HTTP Server by calling [com.twitter.util.concurrent.Await](https://twitter.github.io/util/docs/com/twitter/util/Await$.html) `.ready` method and giving our [Awaitable](https://twitter.github.io/util/docs/com/twitter/util/Awaitable.html) a chance to complete, or be interruped ( by control-c ).

We can now execute this probject using SBT.

```s
$ sbt sbt "runMain example.SampleApp"
[info] Loading settings from build.sbt ...
...
[info] Running example.SampleApp 
Aug 27, 2018 5:13:05 PM com.twitter.finagle.Init$ $anonfun$once$1
INFO: Finagle version 18.8.0 (rev=b12759650084cd4eaa890045f1f921127b368d20) built at ...
```

Console output of service show just the build time for Finagle. Because we setup a LogginFilter, we can visit the running Service and observe it's log output once we have accessed an serviceendpoint.

```s
$ curl http://localhost:8080
Minimum target sample is: 42

$ curl http://localhost:8080\?next=6
Minimum target sample is: 6
```

Whereas our logs will read with the results:

```s
...
INFO: Finagle version 18.8.0 (rev=b12759650084cd4eaa890045f1f921127b368d20) built at 20180806-152739
Aug 27, 2018 5:14:11 PM com.twitter.finagle.filter.LoggingFilter log
INFO: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 - - [28/Aug/2018:00:14:11 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 28 13 "curl/7.54.0"
Aug 27, 2018 5:14:18 PM com.twitter.finagle.filter.LoggingFilter log
INFO: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 - - [28/Aug/2018:00:14:18 +0000] "GET /?next=42 HTTP/1.1" 200 28 3 "curl/7.54.0"\
```

## Customizing your Filter

If the existing filter does not give enough infomration how Filters can be created, and we usually want some kind of custom behaviour. So lets examine what a custom filter looks like. Lets set one up by extending [SimpleFilter](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/docs/com/twitter/finagle/SimpleFilter.html) and supplying the `apply()` method. This example will simply execute an anonymous function (lambda) before completing the http request/response.

```scala
class SampleFilter(val myFn: Unit => Unit) extends SimpleFilter[Request, Response] {
  override def apply(request: Request, service: Service[Request, Response]): Future[Response] = {
    myFn()
    service(request)
  }
}
```

Now that we have our custom filter, lets compose our improved service with some logic. Back to our SampleApp, we can initialize the service with our filter and a simple and conveneint lambda.

```scala
object SampleApp extends App {
  val service: Service[Request, Response] = MyLoggingFilter
    .andThen(new SampleFilter(req => Logger().info(s"Request path: ${req.path}")))
    .andThen(SampleService)

```

Now when we access our service via `curl`, we should see output on our server's log similar to the following:

```s
Aug 27, 2018 9:03:18 PM example.SampleApp$ $anonfun$service$1
INFO: Request path: /fizzfoo
Aug 27, 2018 9:03:18 PM com.twitter.finagle.filter.LoggingFilter log
INFO: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 - - [28/Aug/2018:04:03:18 +0000] "GET /fizzfoo HTTP/1.1" 200 28 19 "curl/7.54.0"

```
